Images for GitHub Desktop issue with menu rendering

Issue: [desktop/desktop #6788](https://github.com/desktop/desktop/issues/6788)

Original description:
OS: Windows 10 Enterprise, version 1809, build 17763.253

Description: On "Let's Get Started!" screen, the menu bar is not readily displayed; it appears to be white on white. Mouseover reveals menu items as white text on black, but clicking items does not open the menu, only changes the rendering to white text on black (and changes back once the menu item is "deselected").

Accessing menu items via keyboard shortcuts (e.g. Alt+F to open the File menu) similarly only changes the rendering of the menu item and does not open the menu.
